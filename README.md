# Project 3 Group 3: Formula One Visualization Website

## Overview
This project is a full stack website with interactive visualizations and a map exploring Formula 1 data from 1950 to present (up until the midseason break in 2024). The website was designed to be a first resource for new fans rather than providing more in depth, niche information for established fans. The color scheme for the website was based on the established Formula 1 color scheme.

While the website is fairly accurate for more modern races, a number of early results and drivers are likely to have been eliminated from the visualizations due to null values. Given database constraints, these values weren't able to be included. However, that's the primary limitation of the website. Had the authors had more time, more information and visualizations would have been included. As it is, only 6 of the 14 CSVs provided in the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).
